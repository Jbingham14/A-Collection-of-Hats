## About the Collection

This collection contains images of hats. These hats belong to Jerome Bingham, a 26-year-old college student from Indiana. He hopes that this collection will give insight on hat culture from the early 2020’s and could provide historical examples of hat wearing in the future of fashion studies. The range of these hats range from 2010 to 2022. The oldest hat is from a Detroit Tigers baseball game in 2010. The newest hat is from November 2022 and is merchandise from the Formula One Club at IU. These hats range is types, brands, and manufacturers.

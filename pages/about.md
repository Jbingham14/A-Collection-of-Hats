## About the Collection

Technical Documentation

Items Chosen

These items are all hats that I own and thus there should not be any copyright concerns. I chose hats for this project because I wanted to work with a collection of my own and do something that did not require me to visit another repository. 
Imaging Standards

These photos were taken with a Nikon D5300 with a 18-55mm lens. The photos are 300 dpi both in horizontal and vertical resolution. They were taken with 1/80 second exposure and an f-stop of f/8. The ISO was set to 200 without flash.
These photos were taken using this Nikon and a Neewer Photo Studio Light Box both rented from the IU Wells Makerspace. These photos were then uploaded and save on my home pc. I then uploaded and renamed the photos and then uploaded to GitHub. I took photos from various angles but with my difficulty using GitHub I figured it was better to just feature the frontal images of the hats. 

Metadata Standards

The metadata for this project uses the metadata scheme of Dublin Core and one custom value I called “brand” The values of individual elements are subject to both custom and established controlled vocabularies such as the Library of Congress Name Authority and the Getty Art and Architecture Thesaurus.
Below is an explanation of what Dublin Core and text item type elements are used and what standards have been applied to their input.

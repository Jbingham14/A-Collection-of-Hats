## About the Collection

About the Platform

This site is generated using CollectionBuilder-GH, a project to create a free and simple digital collection using GitHub Pages from:
•	a CSV of collection metadata
•	a folder of JPG images or PDF documents

About the Collection
This collection contains images of hats. These hats belong to Jerome Bingham, a 26-year-old college student from Indiana. He hopes that this collection will give insight on hat culture from the early 2020’s and could provide historical examples of hat wearing in the future of fashion studies. The range of these hats range from 2010 to 2022. The oldest hat is from a Detroit Tigers baseball game in 2010. The newest hat is from November 2022 and is merchandise from the Formula One Club at IU. These hats range is types, brands, and manufacturers.

About the Creator

This digital collection is brought to by Jerome Bingham. Jerome is currently a second-year MA student at Indiana University. He is currently studying Library Science and plans to graduate in May of 2023. This digital collection was made as part of Z652 Digital Libraries, Fall 2022, Section 3874 and was taught by professor John A. Walsh and TA Alex Wingate. 


Technical Documentation

Items Chosen

These items are all hats that I own and thus there should not be any copyright concerns. I chose hats for this project because I wanted to work with a collection of my own and do something that did not require me to visit another repository. 
Imaging Standards

These photos were taken with a Nikon D5300 with a 18-55mm lens. The photos are 300 dpi both in horizontal and vertical resolution. They were taken with 1/80 second exposure and an f-stop of f/8. The ISO was set to 200 without flash.
These photos were taken using this Nikon and a Neewer Photo Studio Light Box both rented from the IU Wells Makerspace. These photos were then uploaded and save on my home pc. I then uploaded and renamed the photos and then uploaded to GitHub. I took photos from various angles but with my difficulty using GitHub I figured it was better to just feature the frontal images of the hats. 

Metadata Standards

The metadata for this project uses the metadata scheme of Dublin Core and one custom value I called “brand” The values of individual elements are subject to both custom and established controlled vocabularies such as the Library of Congress Name Authority and the Getty Art and Architecture Thesaurus.
Below is an explanation of what Dublin Core and text item type elements are used and what standards have been applied to their input.

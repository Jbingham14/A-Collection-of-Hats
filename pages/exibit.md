## Sports Fandom and its Identity Through Hats

  For this exhibit I wanted to focus on caps that feature some sort of sports branding. In my collection I have four of these such hats. The are My Red Bull Racing hat, my Ferrari F1 hat, my Spurs, and my Pacers cap. The latter two are flat bill, also known as the snapback. Writer for Medium.com notes that “the baseball team Brooklyn Excelsiors wore the first snapbacks in 1958[^1].” The snapback would gain popularity during the 1990’s when hip-hop was sweeping the nations and rap groups such as N.W.A popularized the trend. Today these hats are commonplace for teams to sell. The Spurs hat and the Pacers hat are from two different manufacturers. One of them is Mitchell & Ness, which gained popular recently especially with their throwback hats such as the Spurs Fiesta hat that I own.  The other company is New Era which may be the standard bearer when it comes to sports hat production. Carol Motsinger of the Cincinnati Enquirer writes I her article ‘We know why you wear a baseball cap’, that “in 1934, New Era created its first professional baseball cap for the Cleveland Indians. Twenty years later, the headwear company introduced a fitted cap known as the 59Fifty. And that's what every ball player wears today[^2].” The Pacers hat is a great example of this fitted snapback cap. 
  The other two other hats are from the world of Formula One Racing when fans can get heated over which drivers and teams they support. The two teams represented in my collection are Ferrari F1 and Red Bull Racing. These two teams faced off in a heated championship fight this year which ended in late November 2022. L Jon Wetheim of Sports Illustrated and sports psychologist Sam Sommers write about sports and the impact it has on the brains of sports fans in their book This is Your Brain On Sports. In their chapter ‘Tribal Warfare’ note that “In other words, only when the other team was their big rival did watching its slipups create just as powerful an emotion as seeing their favorite team succeed[^3].” Sports fandom is wild, and their fans are passionate and intense. One of the best ways to show this support is for fans to express their favoritism in a way that resembles tribalism.
